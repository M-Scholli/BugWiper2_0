- Modelcraft RB350018-2A723R Hochleistungsgetriebemotor 12 V 18:1 :https://www.conrad.de/de/p/modelcraft-rb350018-2a723r-hochleistungsgetriebemotor-12-v-18-1-233131.html
- dual H-Bridge Motor driver L298 3A
- 45mm Diameter Cable Drum

#### Problems:
- Motor Driver had a high voltage drop, which reduced the motor power
- Motor was not enough torque for higher speeds
- Motor was to easy to rotate when powered off. The spring in the bug wiper wings pulled the cable out a bit.
- The GFK spring pulled out the cable after stopping the motor and turned the motor backwards
- the GFK spring is not only bending as intended, but although twisting dependent on the spooling direction of the cable drum. This results that the outboard stop switch is reached at 5-6 kg in one direction and at 2-3 kg in the other direction. So that in one direction the Motor not automatically stops when the bug wiper wings reaching the fuselage and in the other direction the motor stops all the time in the middle of the wing.
- The high pull force of the cable tightens the cable sometimes so strong, that at the next winding out the windings are pressed so strong together, that the spool is pulling the wings back inwards after a couple of rotations

### Version 1.1
